# Up Saver Display

This project started after I wanted to see what data you can retrive from the [Up Bank API](https://developer.up.com.au). I decided to make a simple yet functional application to reinforce my knowledge and apply what I was learning.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Node.js + Express.js** â€” backend server and API integration
- **Vite + React** â€” fast frontend development and build tool
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** â€” for real-time updates using webhooks
- **Up Bank API** â€” to access account balance and transaction data
- **Render** - for hosting my application  
- **ngrok** - to run the backend server and test with webhooks

## ðŸ“¦ Deployment

- Backend and frontend are hosted using [Render](https://render.com/)
- You can visit the deployed app here: 
```

```

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. The backend listens for webhook events from Up Bank (e.g transfer money TO or FROM my "Holiday' saving account).
2. On send/receive of a new transaction, the webhook pushes a custom event to all connected clients via SSE.
3. The frontend listens to these events and updates the display with an animation in real-time.
